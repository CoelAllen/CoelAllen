### Hi there 👋

My name is Coel Allen. I'm a Software and DevOps Engineer at Always Connect Solutions, where I build full-stack applications and manage cloud infrastructure.
Previously, I worked as a consulting developer at Hidden Mountain Data, where I gained experience across diverse tech stacks and client environments. My non-traditional path into tech—including years in restaurant management and business operations—gives me a unique perspective on solving real-world business problems through code.
I specialize in AWS cloud solutions, database optimization, and modern web frameworks. I'm passionate about system architecture, performance optimization, and building scalable solutions. I love diving deep into how systems work and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

💾 Tech Stacks: AWS (Lambda, ECS, RDS, S3), PostgreSQL, Vue.js, Nuxt, TypeScript, Node.js, Terraform, Docker, Tailwind CSS, Prisma
