### Hi there 👋

My name is Coel Allen.  I am currently a freelance developer working on several projects.  My background is extremely varied. I have worked in grocery stores and restaurants, been a security guard and a USPS mail handler.  Puzzles and problems solving interest me greatly and the dev world seemed like a perfect fit.  I love seeing into the machinery of a system and learning why it does what it does.

After 8 years of restaurant management and running a spirits distributor, I fell in love with the tech-side of those industries.  This led to me to software development, combining my passions for technology and creative problem solving.

+ 💾 **Tech Stacks:** Javascript(Vue.js and currently learning React), C#, .Net Core, MySQL, Node.js, Mongo.db, CSS/Bootstrap, HTML & more.
