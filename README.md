### Hi there 👋

My name is Coel Allen.  I am currently a consulting developer working at Hidden Mountain Data.  Getting here was quite a journey and I followed an extremely varied career path. I have worked in grocery stores and restaurants, been a security guard and a USPS mail handler, I've made coffee and weighed bolts at a hardware manufacturer.  But none of these fields quite scratched that itch.  

I spent the last 8 years in restaurant management and running a spirits distributor.  Making menus, updating websites and running spreadsheets made me fall in love with the tech-side of those industries.  A friend recommended software development, combining my passions for technology and creative problem solving.

Puzzles and logic problems interest me greatly, so the dev world seemed like a perfect fit.  I love seeing into the machinery of a system and learning why it does what it does. Contact me below and let's get cracking!
